# image-lab

## Overview

**Image Matrix Transformer** is a simple Java Swing application that allows you to load images and apply matrix transformations to their color (e.g., RGB) and coordinate properties. This tool is designed to help you visualize how matrices can be used to alter images, providing a better understanding of linear as well as affine transformations in the context of image processing.

## Features

- Load images from various formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, BMP)
- Apply matrix transformations to image colors (RGB)
- Apply matrix transformations to image coordinates
- Visualize the effects of different matrix transformations
- Save transformed images

## Good to know

- Image transformations are generally calculated relatively to the center of the image, not the top left corner
- The cartesian coordinate system is used for matrix transformations
- Color transformation is currently only supported on images with a color spectrum representable as a 3x1 matrix (e.g., RGB)
